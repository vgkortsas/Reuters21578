# Reuters21578

This project is about text classification using the Reuters21578 dataset. This is an example of multi-class multi-label classification problem, where also the classes are imbalanced.

You can download the data from http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/reuters21578/reuters21578.html

I used the 20 most frequent classes for the classification. These are the classes which appear in 72\% of the 21,578 documents. 

Applying the trained model on the testing data for the optimized architecture I got an F1-score of 0.82
